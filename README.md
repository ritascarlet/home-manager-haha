# home-manager-haha
# Home-manager for any linux distribution

A small home-amanger concept like on nixos, but it works much simpler

# How does it work? (yes, I feel like I'm fucking) 

It's very simple! It takes files from the home-manager folder, which is located on the /home/user/ path, and then replaces them in the .config folder

Yes, the functionality is crap, but this is still a concept that I will publish just to be

# How to install? 

Just copy the already compiled home-manager file to /usr/bin, and then use the "home_manager update" command

# Do you want to compile it yourself? What the hell to do, keep the command

```bash

gcc -o home_manager home_manager.c

```
